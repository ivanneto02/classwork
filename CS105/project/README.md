## Machine Learning

1) Clean up the reports
    - Based on regular expressions and `my_stopwords.py`

2) Vectorize each tokenized report
    - create onegrams, bigrams, and trigrams (and maybe ngrams if time permits)

3) Feed onegrams, bigrams, and trigrams into NN model
    - Basic MLP
    - Basic CNN
