
\noindent \textbf{Problem 3: } Consider a modification of the Turing Machine model where, in addition to left and right moves, we also allow stationary moves $S$, in which the machine does not change its location on the tape. (Except for these new features, use the same TM convention as in Sipser's book.)

\begin{itemize}
    \item[(a)] Give a precise, formal definition of a Turing Machine with stationary moves.
    \item[(b)]  Prove that Turing Machines with stationary moves accept only Turing recognizable languages. You must give a complete and formal proof.
\end{itemize}
