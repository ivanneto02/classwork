
\noindent \textbf{Problem 2: } Consider a modified Turing Machine model called a \textit{List Turing Machine (LTM)}. A List Turing Machine, in addition to rewriting symbols, can also \textit{delete} the current symbol, or \textit{insert} a new symbol right before the current symbol. (Except for these new features, use the same TM convention as in Sipser's book.)

\begin{itemize}
    \item[(a)] Give a precise, formal definition of a List Turing Machine. Donâ€™t forget to give the definition of the language $L(M)$ accepted by a LTM $M$.
    \item[(a)] Prove that List Turing Machines recognize only Turing recognizable languages. (In other words, you need to prove that if $M$ is a List Turing Machine then there is a (standard) Turing Machine $M^{'}$ with $L(M^{'}) = L(M).$)
\end{itemize}
