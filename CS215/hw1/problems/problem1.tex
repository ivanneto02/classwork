
\noindent \textbf{Problem 1:} Design a Turing Machine for the language $L_1$ given below.

$$L_1 = \{a^i b^j c^{ij} : i, j \geq 0\}.$$

\noindent Use the Turing Machine model with 2-way infinite tape. Your solution should consist of

\begin{itemize}
    \item[(a)] a high-level description in plain English of the underlying algorithm (at most 100 words),
    \item[(b)] the state diagram (picture) of your Turing Machine, and
    \item[(c)] the transition function, in the syntax consistent with the Turing Machine simulator at https://
    turingmachinesimulator.com/. (Include the transition function in your assignment using the verbatim environment of LaTeX.)
\end{itemize}

\noindent The correctness of your TM will be determined by running it on a collection of test inputs, using the simulator at https://turingmachinesimulator.com/. So make sure that your TM works correctly on all legal inputs(all strings consisting of $a$'s, $b$'s and $c$'s).
