\noindent Since $u \in \Sigma^*$, assume $u = \epsilon$. In this case, $L(G) = \{uv : v \in \Sigma^*\} = \{v : v \in \Sigma^*\}$.

\noindent I shall assume that there is a turing machine $F$ that decides the problem of
whether $L(G) = \{v : v \in \Sigma^*\}$. Since $v$ is any word in $\Sigma^*$, $F$ rejects on
an infinitely looping input, and rejects on a rejecting input. Similarly, it accepts in an accepting
input. This is equal to $A_{TM}$, which in Theorem 4.11 we prove to be undecidable.

\noindent Assuming the decision problem to be decidable implies $A_{TM}$ is decidable, which it is not.

\vskip 0.1in

\noindent By contradiction, this decision problem is undecidable, due to being reducible to $A_{TM}$.
