
\noindent \textbf{Problem 1:} Is the following decision problem decidable? Give a complete proof. (It is sufficient to give an
appropriate reduction and justify its correctness.)

\begin{itemize}
    \item[] \textit{Instance} A TM \textit{M}, a word $w$;
    \item[] \textit{Query:} Is \textit{M} ever in the same state twice in a row in the computation on $w$?
\end{itemize}

\noindent To clarify, the decision problems asks whether M, in the computation on w, ever executes a transition of the form $\&(q, a) = (q, b, \mu)$, staying in the same state.
