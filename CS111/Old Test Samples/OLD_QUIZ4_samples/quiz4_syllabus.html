                <li>
                Given the pseudo-code below,
                what is the (asymptotic) number

        <li> Inclusion-Exclusion

                <ul>

                <li>
                Give a complete statement of the
                inclusion-exclusion principle.

                <li>
                Suppose that we have sets A, B, C
                such that
                |A|= 22, |B| = 36, |C| = 26,
 				|A &#8745; B| = 2|A &#8745; B &#8745; C|,
				|A &#8745; C| = 3|A &#8745; B &#8745; C|,
				|B &#8745; C| = 4|A &#8745; B &#8745; C|,
				|A &#8746; B &#8746; C| = 13|A &#8745; B &#8745; C|.
                Determine the number of elements
                in the  of these three sets.

                <li>
				Compute the number of permutations of {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}
				in which either 2,3,4 are consecutive or 4,5 are
				consecutive or 8,9,2 are consecutive.

                <li>
                We have a group of 53 people,
                including 22 US citizens, 15 Mexican
                citizens, and 27 Canadian citizens.
                Among them, 4 people have a dual
                US-Mexican citizenship,
                5 have US-Canadian citizenship,
                and 6 have Canadian-Mexican
                citizenship. How many people have
                a triple citizenship?

				<li>
				Compute &#966(440) (&#966(n) is the Euler totient function).
<!--
				<li>
				Give the number of solutions of x+y+z = 30, for
				4 &#8804; x &#8804; 14, 3 &#8804; y &#8804; 17, 10 &#8804; z &#8804; 25.
