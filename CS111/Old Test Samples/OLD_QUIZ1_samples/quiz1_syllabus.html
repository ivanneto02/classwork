<BR>
<BR>
The entrance quiz will focus mostly on the topics from 
CS/MATH 11, but one question from algebra is possible too.

<P>
<B> Topics: </B>

<p>
<ul>

<li> Logic. Prepositional and predicate calculi,
        conjunction, disjunction, negation,
        DeMorgan Laws, quantifiers.
        <br>
        Examples: 
		<ol>
			<li>Negate the following
        sentence: "For each integer x, there is
        an integer y, such that for each integer z,
        2xy - zx + 2 = 0."
			<li> Are the two statements below equivalent?
				<ul>
					<li> "It is not true that for each x, if x is omnilicious then x is bulganimic"
					<li> "There is an x that is omnilicious and not bulganimic"
		</ol>

<li> Sets. Notations for sets. Set operations (union,
	intersection, complement, difference),
	finite and infinite sets,
	countable sets and uncountable sets.
        Operations on sets: union, intersection,
	the power set, Cartesian products, other.
        <br>
        Examples:
 		<ol>
			<li> List all elements of
        			the Cartesian product of X = {a,c,x} and Y = {b,z}.
        <li> Let N denote the set of natural numbers.
                        Give a 1-1 function between NxN and N.
		</ol>

<li> Functions. Functions onto and 1-1. 
	The inverse and composition of functions.
	
<li> Relations. Properties of relations (reflexive, transitive,
		symmetric, anti-symmetric). Equivalence relations and
		equivalence classes. Partial orders.

	<br>
	Examples:
	<ol>
	<li> Let X be the set of integers 3,4,...,13. Define relation R on X as 
		follows: xRy iff x<sup>2</sup> = y<sup>2</sup> (mod 3).
		Prove that X is an equivalence relation and give its equivalence classes.

	<li> Define relation R on the set of natural numbers as 
	follows: xRy iff x is a divisor of y. 
	Prove that X is a partial order.

	</ol>

<li> Basic algebra: solving quadratic equations,
		solving equations of degree 3 and higher (by guessing integral roots),
		solving systems of
        linear equations, matrices, matrix multiplication,
        determinants.
		<br>
		Examples:
		<ol>
			<li> Solve x<sup>2</sup> + 3x + 4 = 0
				
			<li> Solve  x<sup>3</sup> -3x<sup>2</sup> + 4x -2 = 0

			<li> Find x,y such that 3x+2y = 7 and 2x- y = -2

			<li> Find x,y such that 2x+y = 3 and x<sup>2</sup> + y + 1 = 0
		
		</ol>
			
<li> Proof methods (induction, contradiction).
        <br>
        Examples: 
		<ol>
			<li> Prove by induction that an n-element
        set has 2<sup>n</sup> subsets.
			<li> Prove that 1+2+...+n = n(n+1)/2.
			<li> Prove that 1<sup>2</sup>+2<sup>2</sup>+...+n<sup>2</sup> = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6.
		</ol>

<li> Basic counting :
        permutations, combinations, subsets, functions,
        identities involving binomial
        expressions

	<br>
	Examples: 
	<ol>
		<li> In how many ways we can order a set of 6 elements?
		<li> There are 10 students in class. We choose 3 of them. In how many ways this can be done?
		<li> There are 5 students in class. Each will be assigned a grade of A, B or C. In how many
				ways this can be done?

	</ol>

<li> Summation formulas, computing closed forms,
        arithmetic and geometric sums.

	<br>
	Examples: 
	<ol>
	<li> What is the sum of 1+2+ ... + n?
	<li> What is the sum of n + (n+1) + (n+2) + ... + 2n?
	<li> What is the sum 1+ 3 + 3<sup>2</sup> + ... + 3<sup>n </sup>?
	<li> What is the sum of 1 + 1/3 + 1/9 + 1/27 + ... ?

	</ol>

<li> Elementary number theory:
        prime numbers, factorization, relatively prime numbers,
        greatest common divisor,  least common multiple.

	<br>
	Examples: 
	<ol>
		<li> Compute the factorization of 5462.
		<li> What is the greatest common divisor of 459 and 931? 
	</ol>

</ul>
