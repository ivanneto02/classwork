<ul>

        <li> The RSA
                <ul>
                <li>
                Explain the principle of
                public-key cryptosystems

                <li>
                Explain the RSA (initialization,
                encryption, decryption)

                <li>
                Suppose that Bob chooses p = 5,
                q = 11. Show some correct values of
                e (public exponent) and d (secret
                exponent). Give three correct pairs.

				<li>
				Bob uses P = (143,19) as his public
				key and S = 21 as his secret key.
				Is Bob's system correct?

                <li>
                Suppose Bob chooses p =7, q = 13,
                e = 11. Determine d. If Alice wants
                to send M = 10 to Bob, what is
                the ciphertext?

                </ul>

<li> Famous problems in number theory (state):
		Fermat's Last Theorem,
		Goldbach Conjecture,
		Twin Primes Conjecture,
		Primality Testing,
		Factorization,
		The Prime Number Theorem.


        <li> Linear homogeneous recurrences equations

                <ul>

                <li>
                Give the recurrence relation for
                Fibonacci numbers.

                <li> 
                Setting up recurrence equations.
				<ul>
					<li>
						Example:
					One female rabbit produces 3 female rabbits
					per week, starting the 2nd week after its born.
					You receive one newly-born female rabbit for
					your birthday. How many female rabbits you will have
					after n weeks? (These are genetically
					modified female rabbits that do not need male rabbits
					for reproduction.)
					
					<li>
						Example: We tile an n-by-1 strip using 1-by-1,
						2-by-1 and 3-by-1 tiles. Let t<sub>n</sub> be the
						number of such tilings. Give a recurrence for  t<sub>n</sub>.
						
					<li>
						Example: Modify the last problem by allowing tiles
						of two colors, say red and green. Give a recurrence for
						the number of such tilings.
						
				</ul>

                <li> 
                Solving linear homogeneous recurrence equations.

				<ul>
					
				<li> Example: Solve:
                f<sub>n</sub> = 5f<sub>n-1</sub> - 6f<sub>n-2</sub>,
                with initial conditions
                f<sub>0</sub> = 1,
                f<sub>1</sub> = 2. Show your work.

				<li>
				Example:
				Determine the general solution of the
				recurrence
				h<sub>n</sub> = 5h<sub>n-1</sub> -3h<sub>n-2</sub>
									- 9 h<sub> n-3</sub>
				</ul>

                </ul>

</ul>
