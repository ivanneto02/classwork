Problem 5: Solve the following recurrence equation:

$f_n = 13f_{n-2} + 12f_{n-3} + 2n + 1$



This problem requires $5$ steps:

1. Find the characteristic equation of the homogeneous equation associated with the recurrence
   - Find the roots of this characteristic equation

2. Determine whether $s$ is in the roots of the characteristic equation, in order to ascertain the general form of the non-homogeneous equation associated with the recurrence.
3. Ascertain the non-homogeneous equation associated with the recurrence.
4. Use the recurrence to find the particular solution $\beta$
5. Use the initial conditions to find the values of the remaining parameters in the recurrence relation (the ones in the form $\alpha _ 1$).
