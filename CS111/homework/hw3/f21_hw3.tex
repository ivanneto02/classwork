\begin{problem}
We want to tile an $n\times 1$ strip with tiles of three types: $1\times 1$ tiles that are dark-blue, light-blue, and red, $2\times 1$ green and $3\times 1$ sky-blue tiles. a) Give a formula for the number of tilings $A_n$. b) Now give a formula for the number of tilings $T_n$, considering that blue tiles cannot be next to each other. Your solution must include a recurrence equation (with initial conditions!), and a full justification. You do not need to solve it. 

%\noindent In how many ways can be tiled a $5\times 1$ strip?
\end{problem}
