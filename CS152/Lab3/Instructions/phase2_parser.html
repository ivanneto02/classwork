<h2><u>cs152 Project Phase 2: Parser Generation Using <i>bison</i></u></h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
In the previous phase of the class project, you used the <i>flex</i> tool to create a
lexical analyzer for your programming language that reads in a program
(from a text file) and identifies the sequence of lexical tokens in the text file.
In this phase of the class project, you will create a parser using the <i>bison</i>
tool that will check to see whether the identified sequence of tokens adheres to the
specified grammar of your language.

The output of your parser will be the list of productions used during the parsing
process.  If any syntax errors are encountered during parsing, your parser
should emit appropriate error messages.  Additionally, you will be required to submit
the grammar for your language that you will need to write before you can use <i>bison</i>.

syntax diagrams <a href="syntax.html">here</a> that describe the appropriate structure of the various MINI-L statements.</i>] <br>
[<i>The required output format for your parser is described <a href="production_rule_format.html">here</a>.</i>]

<h3>Bison</h3>

<p>
<i>Bison</i> is a tool for generating parsers.  Given a specified context-free grammar for a
language, <i>bison</i> will automatically produce an LALR(1) bottom-up parser for that
language.  The parser will ensure that a given sequence of tokens are ordered in such a way
that they adhere to the specified grammar of the language.  If the tokens fail to parse
properly, then appropriate syntax error messages are outputted.
</p>

<p>
<i>Shift/Reduce and Reduce/Reduce conflicts:</i><br>
When ambiguities exist in the specified grammar, <i>bison</i> will emit one or more
<i>conflicts</i> when it is run.  These conflicts do not prevent <i>bison</i> from
generating the parser from your specification, but they may unexpectedly affect how your parser
behaves.  A shift/reduce conflict occurs when the parser may
perform either a <i>shift</i> or a <i>reduce</i>.  A reduce/reduce conflict occurs when
there are two or more production rules that apply to the same sequence of input tokens.
In general, reduce/reduce conflicts indicate errors in the grammar (or at least serious
ambiguities) and should be eliminated by modifying the grammar specification as needed.
Shift/reduce conflicts, on the other hand, are more difficult to completely eliminate,
especially when using the special "error" token provided by <i>bison</i> to handle
errors.  Therefore, you should try to eliminate as many shift/reduce conflicts as you
can, but some shift/reduce conflicts may remain as long as they do not adversely affect
the behavior of your parser.  You can run <i>bison</i> with
the <code>-v</code> option to generate an output file containing detailed information about
each conflict.
</p>

<p>
In our department, <i>bison</i> is installed and can be used on lab machines and the "<i>bolt</i>" server.

<h3>Detailed Requirements</h3>

The following tasks will need to be performed to complete this phase of the project.

<ol>
<li> First, you will need to write the grammar for your programming language.
<font color="red">You must submit this grammar along with the other files required
for this phase of the class project!</font>
<li> Create the <i>bison</i> parser specification file using the grammar.  Ensure
that you specify helpful syntax error messages to be outputted by the parser in the
event of any syntax errors.<br>
Example: write the <i>bison</i> specification in a file named <code>mini_l.y</code>.
<li> Run <i>bison</i> to generate the parser for MINI-L using your specification.
The <code>-d</code> flag is necessary to create a <code>.h</code> file that will link
your <i>flex</i> lexical analyzer and your <i>bison</i> parser.  The <code>-v</code>
flag is helpful for creating an output file that can be used to analyze any conflicts
in <i>bison</i>.  The <code>--file-prefix</code> option can be used to
change the prefix of the file names outputted by <i>bison</i>. <br>
Example: execute the command <code>bison -v -d --file-prefix=y mini_l.y</code>.  This will
create the parser in a file called <code>y.tab.c</code>, the necessary <code>.h</code> file
called <code>y.tab.h</code>, and the informative output file called <code>y.output</code>.
<li> Ensure that your language lexical analyzer from the first phase of the class project
has been constructed. <br>
Example: if your lexical analyzer specification is in a file called <code>mini_l.lex</code>, then
use it with <i>flex</i> as follows: <code>flex mini_l.lex</code>.  This will create the
lexical analyzer in a file called <code>lex.yy.c</code>.
<li> Compile everything together into a single executable. <br>
Example: compile your parser into the executable <code>parser</code>
with the following command: <code>gcc -o parser y.tab.c lex.yy.c -lfl</code>.
The program <code>parser</code> should now be available for use.
</ol>

<hr>


<h3>Example Usage</h3>

<p>
Suppose your parser is in the executable named <code>parser</code>.  Then for
the MINI-L program <a href="fibonacci.min">fibonacci.min</a>, your parser should be
invoked as follows:
</p>

<p>
<code>cat fibonacci.min  | parser</code>
</p>

<p>
The list of productions taken by your parser during parsing should then be printed to the screen.
As one example, the output might look like <a href="../Min L Examples/fibonacci.parse">this</a> (you do not
need to number each production or label each non-terminal with the corresponding production number).
However, your output may be different due to different productions in your specification.  The most
important thing is that your parser should <i>not</i> output any syntax errors for
syntactically correct programs, and your parser <i>should</i> output helpful syntax error
messages (for at least the first syntax error) whenever syntax errors do exist in the
inputted MINI-L program.
