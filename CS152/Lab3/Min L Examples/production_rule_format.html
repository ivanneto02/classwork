<h2><u>Output Format for Parser</u></h2>

<h3>Production Rules</h3>

<p>
For grading purposes, we would like your parser to output the list of productions taken
while parsing an inputted sequence of lexical tokens.  These productions should be outputted
in the order in which they are actually taken during parsing.  The general format of each production
should be as follows:
</p>

<p>
<code>
LEFT-HAND-SIDE -> RIGHT-HAND-SIDE
</code>
</p>

<p>
We do not specify the detailed format for each production (such as the names of
the terminals and non-terminals used, and which symbols are present in each production).
This is because these details will depend upon the particular grammar you create.
However, we ask that you pay attention to precendence so that the relative order
of the taken productions adheres to precedence rules (such as "+" and "-" having
lower precendence than "*" and "/").  Although precedence will not really be important
until the next phase of the project, this will make it easier for us during grading
of the current phase.
</p>

<p>
The actual output of your parser may differ depending upon the grammar you write.

<h3>Syntax Error Messages</h3>

<p>
An important function of a parser is to emit helpful syntax error messages in the event of a syntax
error.  Accordingly, your parser must emit a syntax error message whenever a syntax
error is present in the inputted sequence of tokens, and your parser must not emit any
syntax error messages whenever an inputted sequence of tokens is syntactically correct.
</p>

<p>
You are free to choose the particular format of each syntax error message outputted by
your parser.  At a minimum, each syntax error message should include the source code
line number at which the syntax error is encountered.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, multiple syntax errors may exist in an inputted sequence of tokens.
It can be helpful for a parser to try to emit syntax error messages for every syntax error, so that
a programmer can attempt to fix multiple errors before having to re-compile the program.
As a result, your parser should continue parsing even after a syntax error is encountered and
an appropriate syntax error message is emitted.  However, sometimes syntax errors may
"confuse" a parser and so some syntax error messages may be extraneous.  Therefore,
it is okay for your parser to emit some extraneous syntax error messages <i>as long as
the very first syntax error message outputted by your parser accurately describes the first true syntax error
that occurs in the inputted sequence of tokens</i>.
</p>

<p>
<i>Example 1</i>:
</p>

<code>
1. function main; <br>
2. beginparams <br>
3. endparams <br>
4. beginlocals <br>
5. a : integer; <br>
6. endlocals <br>
7. beginbody <br>
8. a = 1 + 2 * 3; <br>
9. endbody <br>
</code>

<p>
In the above MINI-L program, the programmer tries to assign to variable <code>a</code>
at line 8, but uses the incorrect assignment operator (it should be <code>:=</code>).  As
a result, when parsing the above MINI-L program, the following helpful error message
might be emitted: <code>Syntax error at line 8: ":=" expected</code>
</p>

<p>
<i>Example 2</i>:
</p>

<code>
1. function main; <br>
2. beginparams <br>
3. endparams <br>
4. beginlocals <br>
5. a integer; <br>
6. endlocals <br>
7. beginbody <br>
8. a := 1 + 2 * 3; <br>
9. endbody <br>
</code>

<p>
In the above MINI-L program, the programmer forgets the colon between <code>a</code>
and <code>integer</code> at line 5.  The following error message might be emitted by
the parser in this case: <code>Syntax error at line 5: invalid declaration</code>
