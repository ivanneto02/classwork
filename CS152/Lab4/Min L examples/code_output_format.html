<h2><u>Output Format for Code Generator</u></h2>

<h3>MIL Intermediate Code</h3>

<p>
In the event that there are no lexical, syntactic, or semantic errors in the inputted
MINI-L program, your code generator should output the generated MIL program on stdout. 
Refer to the <a href="mil.html">specification of the MIL intermediate code representation</a> 
for more details about MIL code.
</p>

<h3>Semantic Error Messages</h3>

<p>
There are nine types of semantic errors that should be captured by your code generator if
they are present in an inputted MINI-L program.
</p>

<ol>
<li> Using a variable without having first declared it.
<li> Calling a function which has not been defined.
<li> Not defining a main function.
<li> Defining a variable more than once .
<li> Trying to name a variable with the same name as a reserved keyword.
<li> Forgetting to specify an array index when using an array variable (i.e., trying to use an array variable as a regular integer variable).
<li> Specifying an array index when using a regular integer variable (i.e., trying to use a regular integer variable as an array variable).
<li> Declaring an array of size <= 0.
<li> Using continue statement outside a loop.
</ol>

<p>
Note that some of the above semantic errors may actually cause syntax errors during parsing.
For example, if you try to declare a variable with a keyword name, then that will most likely
cause a syntax error during parsing.  That is fine.  What is important is that some type of
error message is emitted if any of the above errors are present.
</p>

<p>
If there are multiple occurrences of the above errors,
your code generator should output an error message for each encountered error.
You are free to choose the particular format of each error message.
At a minimum, each error message should include the source code line number
at which the error is encountered.  If at least one error is encountered, then no
intermediate code should be generated.
</p>

<p>

As an example, consider the following MINI-L program.

<pre>
1. function main;
2. beginparams
3. endparams
4. beginlocals
5. 	n : integer;
6. 	r : array [10] of integer;
7. 	n : array [10] of integer;
8. endlocals
9. beginbody
10. 	read n;
11. 	n := z + 1;
12. 	n := n + r;
13. 	write n;
14. 	continue;
15. endbody
</pre>

<p>
In the above program, there are four semantic errors occurring at lines 7, 11, 12 and 14.
The corresponding error messages that might be emitted by your code generator are shown below.
</p>

<pre>
Error line 7: symbol "n" is multiply-defined.
Error line 11: used variable "z" was not previously declared.
Error line 12: used array variable "r" is missing a specified index.
Error line 14: continue statement not within a loop.
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Error files <a href="errors.min">errors.min</a> and <a href="custom.min">custom.min</a> can be used for testing.
