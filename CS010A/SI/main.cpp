Create two functions (use pass by reference), which:

  Take in a number (n) representing the size of the vector
    - Take in n inputs
    - Add each number to the end of the vector
    - Return the maximum value
    - Invalid inputs?

  Given the populated vector from above:
    - Calculate the mean of the inputs
    - Reverse the vector

  Outputs the vector
    - Must ensure that this function does not alter the vector
